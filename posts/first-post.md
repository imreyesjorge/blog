I built this webpage to learn/test the Next.js framework, in the building process of this site I learn about `getStaticProps()` and `getStaticPaths()`.
<br>
<br>
The process itself of building a website with Next.js is simple, the learning curve is also easy but you **need to know about react**, otherwise it might seem difficult.
<br>
<br>
Next.js can be useful, it has a tool for automatic routing the pages you use in your website. The only thing you need to do for Next.js to auto-build your routes is to simple create a `pages/` directory in your project and inside create your individual pages. For example, creating the file `pages/index.js` automatically creates the route `/`, and creating something like `pages/about.js` automatically creates the route `/about` and so on...
