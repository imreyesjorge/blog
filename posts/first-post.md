I built this webpage to learn/test the Next.js framework, in the building process of this site I learn about `getStaticProps()` and `getStaticPaths()`.

The process itself of building a website with Next.js is simple, the learning curve is also easy but you **need to know about react**, otherwise it might seem difficult.
